Simple Shell Project:
Concepts:
Loops, Functions, System calls
Basics of thinking like a programmer
Basics of C
Group Work, though I went solo in this one
A shell in and of itself is a program that interacts with the O.S directly
	Takes in commands in text form from the keyboard through the stdin which is usually the terminal, parses and executes the commands
based on the commands given.
	Going through the concept page
But This day I created the header that I utilize through the project

Fork();
	Creates an alternate process executes and returns to the parent process and also executes it
	Fork's return value dictates where the process is being executed.
	If pid is 0 then it's within the child process
	else is in the calling process(Parent process)
